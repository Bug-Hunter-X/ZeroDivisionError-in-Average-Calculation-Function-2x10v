This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. The function handles the case of an empty list by returning 0. However, there is a potential issue with the function, if the list contains only zeros, the average is also returned as zero. This may not be the desired behavior in some contexts. The solution provided addresses this issue by explicitly handling cases with zero values appropriately.
